### Slide 1 - instructor intro
- Hello my name is Robert Santos I am an instructor here at coding dojo
    - I would like to congratulate you all in being here and taking intrest in becomeing a software engineer. its a truley rewarding experiece its exciting cause you get experience whats its like to create and solve problems.
    - I am going to talk about what we teach, why we teach it, the tools we use, and I am going to be breaking down the diffrent programs we offer.
    - lets go to the next slide and talk about what it is we are teaching.

### Slide 2 - Full stack developer
- When we go to a website you see somthing that looks like a poster. That people can look at and get information from. I.E. somthing you might see that your favorite restaraunt shows you there menu, or make a resurvation and thats it.
- We are going to be creating applications. 
- we are recreating fuctinality that netflix, youtube, facebook, and all those big players have. 
- that functonality all together is called a full stack. 
- So what is a full stack?
- as you see here a stack is comprised of three different sections.
- the front end, this is the visual part of our application. Where the client interacts and sees the infromation.
- Then we have the back end. This is where the logic is, thats where we are loging in, were registering, were processing orders. Think of it as a computer that talks back to the browser.
- All that information all those pictures, text, and images. They need to be stored somwhere. so we need some type of persistance. Thats where the database comes in. our database will be populated with user information, userName, passwords, creditcard info ect...
- The front end is the browser. what you interact with. you send a request to grab infromation or search for somthing it goes to the back end.
- the backend takes that request and sees if the database has the respose we are looking for. if so it is packaged up and sent back to the front end for the user to see.
- So that is pretty much what we are teaching. Not just one time, but 3 times with 3 different languages. which we will see in the next slide.

### Slide 3 - Typical Curriculum Timeline
- This is a road map of the full time program.
- The goal here at the end of the day is to demistrate projects and show what we know on the technologies that we have. The end goal is to be sufficient web devlopers and solve problems.
- Please do not worry if you are new to programming we've got you covered. with programming basics.
    - this is where we learn how to un zip files, use the terminal, and the basics you will need to move forward. so we do that for about a week.
- Then the next three weeks we learn the basics of web development. Thats for the first month
- Then after the first month you will learn python. Python is one of the big laguages
    - this is where we will learn to create our first application. With that functionality I talked about earlier with netflix, youtube, ect..;
- next month is going to be advanced javascript. where you will be diving a bit deeper into front end interaction.
- Then the last month you will be able to choose between Java and C#. And that will be dependent on the needs of your regin.
- Now this next slide will be talking about our daily schedule.

### Slide 4 - Daily Schedule
- This is how your day will be structured during the full time program.
- The full time program is in moutain time. We start at 9.
- we start the day off with algos. Algos are very important this is where we train our problem solving skills. Also prepares us for technical interviews.
- After that first hour of algos, we get into an hour of lecture. Everything is done through zoom and everything is recorded. Lectures are a high level overview of what we learned.
- After that we have time to put what we learned into practice. We brakout into rooms, we do group activities together. 
- Then there is a break at 12. after that it is more of an open lab. where we work on assignment for the day.
- Then in the afternoon around 2 we have our afternoon session, maby a demo where were diving deeper in what we learned in the morning.
- were constantly coding and solving problem. and the cool this is you dont have to do it by yourself. we will be in a room with all your other co-hort mates.
- Then at 5 offical support ends there. But that does not mean its over for you all. You want to use all the time you can to stay on pace with this accelerated program.
- now we know what we are learning. lets take a look at how. In the next slide you will see our text book. 

### Slide 5 - inside the learning platform
- well its actually more than a text book its an online text book. This is our north start. This is our learn platform. 
- This is where you will be turning in assignments, taking exams, getting feedback from your instructors. ect..
- With this platform you will always have guidance on how we are creating something and then you practice it. then you learn the next concept and practice it.
- Alright lets take a look at the time commitment. 

### Slide 6 - The full time commitment
- The full time program takes the most ammount of time. 
- think of it of haveing a full time job and a part time job.
- the 70 - 90 hours a week is a very realalistic time commitment.
- which mean you can have a job if you want to do the full time program.
- This is the part if you want to take it to the next level and accelerate your career faster, that is what the full time program is for.
- 40 hours a week is where you are going to have class/lecture time 9-5
- Then you have 30-50 hours a week where you get to join your peers in the dojo to help problem solve. via zoom, discord, and other mediums.
- to work towards the same goal to become sufficiant web devolpers.
- Now for those that don't have that ammount of time to commit the next slides are for you. 

### Slide 7 - lets talk part-time
- now lets talk part-time. now some of use don't have time time to commit 40 hours plus another 50 on top of that due to having to keep the lights on, kids, pets, ect... 
- so this next slide will talk about the two part time programs we offer.

### Slide 8 - Two part time options
- Here we have the two part time programs we offer
- one starts at 18 weeks.
- we say starts at 18 weeks because you get to choose which technologies you want to learn wich is our accelerated.
- we also have the flex program which is the longest with a minumum ammount of time commitment. we only offer one language for that which is python.
- with the accelerated program. its more than double the ammount of time commitment than the flex but you will finish the program faster.
- we are changing careers were going into something we want to cultivate this passion and that does take a time commitment.
- Alright lets take a look at what the accelerated Curriculum looks like in the next slide

### Slide 9 - Accelerated curriculum
- just like in the full time program you have the same stacks you get to choose its just that the ammount of time gets doubled.
- (point out the times for each stack)
- classes are not everyday which I will point out in a little bit.
- but I wanted to show you that we are all moving towards the same goal. Learning the same stacks and same technologies.
- lets look at an example schedule in the next slide.

### Slide 10 - Accelerated Program: Time Management
- Alright this is a generic schedule from a student in the Accelerated program.
- everything you see in the dark blue is your dojo time. this is the time you will be spending working with the curriculum, solving problems, writing problems, ect...
- and everything in the light blue is your time. your work, time with family, And it looks like this student is extreamly motivated, they wake up at 6am to workout 3 times a week. pretty awesome to see.
- This is just an example, but its always a good idea to have a schedule moving forward. weather your doing full time part time any kind of program in your life have a schedule. It will help you to succeed.
- So lets take a look at the flex Curriculum on the next slide


### Slide 11 - Flex Curriculum 
- this is the one that take the most ammount of time, and minimum ammount of commitment
- we have 8 weeks of web fundamentals
- 16 weeks of python
- then at the end you have 4 weeks of creating awesome projects to show of to employeers and really hone in those problem solving skills with algorithms
- Now lets go to the next stack to learn the two differences between our two different part time programs

### Slide 12 - PT Flex PT Accelerated
- on the left hand side you have the PT flex.
    - this is the one that take the least ammount of time to dedicate per week
- then on the right hand side you have the accelerated
- the part time programs are in pacific time zones and the full time programs are in Moutain time zone.
- ^^Repeat^^
- The lectures are recorded but is not nessicary for you to be present. 
    - I understand that some of us 5pm pacific time zone may be different for others.
- but you will have disscussion questions just like if you were in a university
- so you see here that we meet 3 times a week for the PT accelerated and 2 times a week for the PT Flex.
- the cool thing about the pt program is you have TA support on sun-sat and throughout the week.
- so you are not left out at all you will always have support.
- instructors have class time before lecture, after lecture, they have office hours.
- you have self study, you have your other ninjas that are going to be with you in the program. 
- you will have access to zoom and we use discord for outside class communication.
- so you will never have a shortage of support.
- on the next slide we are going to get to see that all programs use the exact same curriculum learning. 

### Slide 13 - inside the learning platform
- We use the learn platform
- this is the same north star i talked about when talking about the full time program.
- this is where you will be turning in assignments, taking exams, getting feedback from your instructors. ect..
- you will have 24/7 access to it, and you will have access to it 6 months after you graduate.
- there are 3rd party audits that happen all the time, from databases, to the way were teaching, to the information that we give you
- so that you are always up to date on what we have.
- on to the next slide I want to remind you that we are all engineers, we are all problem solvers, were thinking, were creating.
- so this was a little be about the instruction side. and to help us on our journey to become success full web developer I am going to pass it over to our amazing career services.
